MissingOutputException in rule models  in line 25 of /local/workdir/cjl332/tb-cfrna/snakemake_pipeline/workflow/rules/tmp.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/seed_1_sep/GLM/seed_1_sep.GLM.test.txt
output/seed_1_sep/GLM/seed_1_sep.GLM.val.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Removing output files of failed job models since they might be corrupted:
output/seed_1_sep/GLM/seed_1_sep.GLM.rds, output/seed_1_sep/GLM/seed_1_sep.GLM.train.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
